## [Registration for the conference is now open](http://store.southampton.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&deptid=19&catid=95&prodid=395).

To register for the conference [click here](http://store.southampton.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&deptid=19&catid=95&prodid=395).

The registration fee is £120. The fee for speakers and workshop presenters is £80 (a password will have been sent to you).

This fee covers all food and refreshments at the conference, including the [conference dinner](conf2016_dinner).
The fee also covers the cost of a USB flashdrive, on which all of the workshop material will be loaded. Note, that if
you want to take part in the workshops, you must bring your own laptop with USB ports to the conference, that is capable of running virtual 
machines using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org).

The fee does not cover accommodation, which must be arranged separately. Information about hotels in the area is
[available here](conf2016_accommodation).

## Poster Competition

Thanks to our [sponsors](conf2016_sponsors), we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting a poster competition at the conference, with 
prizes available for the best posters.

The poster competition is open to students or early career researchers (or equivalent) who have registered to attend the conference. 
If you would like more details [click here](conf2016_posters).

## Volunteers

We have a limited number of spaces for volunteers to help at the conference. Volunteers will have free registration in return for providing help with staffing desks, helping at workshops, etc. For more detail, please [click here](conf2016_volunteers).

## WSSSPE4 Workshop

You may also be interested in registering for the 4th Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE4). This will be held from the 12th-14th September, immediately before the RSE conference, and also in Manchester. For more information, please visit the [WSSSPE4 website](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe4/).
