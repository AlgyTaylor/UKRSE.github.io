There are regular opportunities for programming researchers in universities and labs across the UK.
A great place to look is [Jobs.ac.uk](http://www.jobs.ac.uk/)

However, where we are made aware of great opportunities for research software engineers, we advertise these here where we can. If you have a job advert you wish to see posted here, please send us a [pull request](https://github.com/UKRSE/UKRSE.github.io)
