If the UK is to continue to be a major research leader,
effort and resources must be invested into nurturing our community of Research Software Engineers
so that the software used in research can meet the demands of the future’s researchers.

It is impossible to get the best out of research software if the people behind that software are
not recognised and rewarded. Although most people enter the career due to the love of applying their skills
to challenging research problems, this passion alone cannot sustain a career. Many Research Software Engineers
move to industry which highly values their valuable expertise. One of the purposes of academia is to provide a
skilled workforce for industry, but it is important to the UK’s research economy to keep some Research Software
Engineers working in research.
