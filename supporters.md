**The Research Software Engineer campaign started life at a [Collaborations Workshop](http://www.software.ac.uk/community/workshops) in 2012, 
which was organised by the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk) (an EPSRC-funded organisation).**

The Software Sustainability Institute’s mission is to improve the situation of software in research. 
Bringing together a community of Research Software Engineers and campaigning for their recognition and reward
will have a huge impact on the quality and esteem of software in research, so the Institute agreed to
provide some funds and effort to kickstart the community, and to campaign on its behalf.

Success for the Research Software Engineer campaign is far more likely if the community becomes self supporting and independent. 
For this reason, the Software Sustainability Institute will continue to support the community and
campaign for Research Software Engineers, but the community will be steered by a committee made up of
Research Software Engineers.
