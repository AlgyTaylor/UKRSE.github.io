As software has become more important in academia, it has required more time and the
development of specialist skills from the people who develop and maintain it.
This led to the creation of a de facto role for people in academia who have expertise in both
software and research. With no formal position in the academic system - and without even a
recognised name for the role - it is difficult for academia to recognise their work.
For this reason, back in 2012 we created the term “Research Software Engineers” and then set about
working to improve their situation in academia.

The first discussions took place at the Collaborations Workshop 2012. 
During which, we discussed the difficulty of getting recognition for an RSE’s work. 
How many RSEs had their names on papers and - more to the point - was this even the right mechanism
for recognising their work? We also discussed the idea of a career as a Research Software Engineer. 
Was there such a thing? Why were so many of them employed as postdoctoral researchers when they didn’t do
conventional research? And was there any way to progress a career as an RSE, or gain a permanent contract,
in research without changing the role by taking on management duties?

Over the next year and a half, we began some informal investigations. Talking at conferences with RSEs,
trying to gain an understanding of how RSEs are employed and what draws people to the role, and
learning about how RSEs are represented to, and valued by, researchers and the academic system.
We found that Research Software Engineers are highly prized within research groups but that their
lack of a formal position in academia makes it difficult to employ and retain their services.
During this time, we identified a group of leading RSEs who agreed to help us organise the first RSE workshop.
These people now make up the first RSE committee.

The popularity of the first RSE workshop in Oxford, held on 11 September 2013, and the discussions that
took place confirmed our early thoughts. The workshop sold out incredible quickly and the people who arrived
from all around the country had experienced many of the same problems: lack of recognition, lack of reward,
no representation in academia, and a difficulty maintaining and progressing a career.
