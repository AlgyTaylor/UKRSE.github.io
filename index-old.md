Academia is yet to adapt to the fundamental role that software plays in today’s research. 
Specifically, the people behind that software - Research Software Engineers (RSEs) - lack recognition and 
reward for the incredible contribution they make to research. 
The RSE Community have come together to raise awareness of this issue, to campaign for change, 
and to share knowledge and collaborate to improve research software.

If you develop software for research (anything from scripts to full-blown software packages), 
we want you to join our community - it’s free! By joining the community, you’ll make new contacts,
learn about new technologies and - most importantly - help us to improve the recognition and
reward for your work.

With the growing importance of software in research, academia needs to recognise and 
reward research software engineering. If the UK is to continue to be a major research leader,
effort and resources must be invested into nurturing our community of Research Software Engineers
so that the software used in research can meet the demands of the future’s researchers.
