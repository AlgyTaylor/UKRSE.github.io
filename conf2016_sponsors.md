This conference would not be possible without the support the EPSRC provides
via the RSE-Network, which we gratefully acknowledge. 

This is the first conference of Research Software Engineers. It's a community conference so we want
to keep registration as low as possible and, where possible, support the attendance of RSEs who do
not have access to funds for conferences. We're expecting around 150 RSEs, from all backgrounds
and disciplines, to attend this first conference.

Research Software Engineers are the people who write the software used in research and make
the technical decisions about which technology is used in research projects. This is the only event
where this community will congregate to learn about the new tools and technologies that could be
used in their work.

We have a number of different sponsorship packages available. We're also flexible! If you have a
different package in mind, [please let us know](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk).

access to funds. Or you can provide support or even prizes for workshops or talks.

If you have something in mind, or would like to discuss options, [please get in touch](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk).


Research Software Engineers and research software developers come from a 
variety of backgrounds and work in a range of different careers and positions.
To ensure the widest access for participants of this conference,
we are actively seeking sponsors. The conference will cater to approximately
150 research software developers and research software engineers from across
the UK and further abroad. Together, they will be engaged in research software
development across all fields of computational research and academic software 
development. If you would like to present a stand, present a sponsored talk,
demonstrate a technology at a sponsored workshop, advertise your logo or
other material on our website or at the conference, or otherwise engage with
this vibrant community of programmers and researchers, then please consider
sponsoring this meeting. For information about sponsorship, prices, and 
different tiers of support, please contact [Simon Hettrick](mailto:s.hettrick@software.ac.uk).
