This conference would not be possible without the support the EPSRC provides
via the RSE-Network, which we gratefully acknowledge. 

This is the first conference of Research Software Engineers. It's a community conference so we want
to keep registration as low as possible and, where possible, support the attendance of RSEs who do
not have access to funds for conferences. We're expecting around 150 RSEs, from all backgrounds
and disciplines, to attend this first conference.

Research Software Engineers are the people who write the software used in research and make
the technical decisions about which technology is used in research projects. This is the only event
where this community will congregate to learn about the new tools and technologies that could be
used in their work.

We have a number of different sponsorship packages available. We're also flexible! If you have a
different package in mind, [please let us know](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk).
