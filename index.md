What is a Research Software Engineer?
=====================================

A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with
an intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is
extremely valuable, the people wiht these skills lack a formal place in the
academic system. This means there is no easy way top recognise their controbution,
to reward them for their contribution, or to represent their views.

Without a name, it is difficult for people to rally around a cause, so we created the term
"Research Software Engineer". We are now working to raise awareness of the role and
bring the community together.

Some Research Software Engineers start off as a conventional researcher who needed to spend time
developing software to progress their research. Because they enjoy this work and have invested 
in developing specialist skills, they wish to continue to focus on software and its use in research.
Others start off from a more conventional software development background and are drawn to research
by the challenge of using software to further research.

The attraction of being a Research Software Engineer is similar to those of being a researcher:
the role attracts people who want to know how the world works. The Research Software Engineer
works with researchers to gain an understanding of the problems they face, and then develops,
maintains and extends software to provide the answers.

Are you a Research Software Engineer?
-------------------------------------

Regardless of your formal job title, if you answer "yes" to many of the following questions,
you are a Research Software Engineer:

1. Are you employed to develop software for research?
2. Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?
3. Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software development?
4. Are you the "preson who does computers" in your research group?
5. Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software 
   used to create them?
6. Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers and conference presentations,
   despite having made a significant contribution through software?
