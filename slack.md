The UKRSE committee have decided that we will use Slack as the forum for discussions within UKRSE. Slack has a slight learning curve, and may be unfamiliar to many people. Once learned, it brings many advantages over mailing lists or other forums.

You can view the UKRSE Slack channel [here](https://ukrse.slack.com). You need to get an account, which we will create for you if you [send us an email](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk?body=SUBSCRIBE%20to%20Slack).

The reasons we chose to use Slack include;

* we have been using Slack successfully within a subsection of the UKRSE community for over a year, and are now confident that we can roll this out to the wider community,
* it provides a nice mix between mailing list discussions (via fluid creation of channels), private group discussions, messengering and private one-to-one communication,
* it has a clean web-based interface, and also great apps for mobile,
* it is designed for discussions, so there is no problem with members complaining about being spammed whenever something interesting comes up,
* it has a very clean and seamless integration with many tools, e.g. Google Docs. It is very easy to associate a google document with a discussion, allowing a discussion group to capture and refine the output of the discussion into a position paper or recommendation,
* it fits better with the way that many younger members of the community communicate. While many of us love email, it is increasingly falling out of use, particularly amongst the RSEs that are now starting their careers. Email filters, RSS readers, mailing lists and "correct netiquette" may be familiar to many of us, but present big barriers that stunt the growth in diversity of our community,
* most importantly, the UKRSE committee regularly use Slack, enabling us to keep abreast of the discussions and moderate them when needed.
