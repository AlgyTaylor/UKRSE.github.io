## RSE Conference Diversity

**Our goal is to create an inclusive, respectful conference environment that invites participation from people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientations.**

We're actively seeking to increase the diversity of our attendees, speakers, and sponsors through our calls for proposals, other open submission processes, and through dialogue with the communities we serve.

This is an ongoing process. We are talking to our program chairs, program committees, and various innovators, experts, and organisations about this goal and about ways they can help us achieve it.

Here are some ways you can help us build a more diverse conference experience:

* Recommend appropriate speakers to the conference chairs. See the [contact pages](conf2016_contact) for information; you may also [email us](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk)
* Forward our call for proposals to relevant affinity groups with the message that we are looking for a diverse speaker roster
* Suggest to potential speakers that they submit a proposal during our [Call for Participation](conf2016_calls) conference phase
* To broaden participation, weâ€™re offering mentoring and other support with your talk or workshop. If you would like to know more, please [get in touch](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk).
* [Suggest ways](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk) that the onsite conference experience can be more welcoming and supportive, free from intimidation and marginalisation
* [Share your ideas](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk) and best practices for how we can realise our vision

We value diversity in the communities we bring together, and we welcome your contributions to bringing balanced representation of the richness of our collective human experience.
