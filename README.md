===============

This page is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Liquid for Designers](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers)

It is published using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) at http://ukrse.github.io/, and we hope will move to
http://rse.ac.uk/

See [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html) for the layout and [stylesheets/stylesheet.css](stylesheets/stylesheet.css) for the styles.

To make new pages, create files called foo.md containing [YAML frontmatter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/):

``` yaml
---
title: The title
layout: default
short: Shortname
---
```

followed by content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
