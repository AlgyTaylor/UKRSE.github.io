**The RSE Conference (15-16 September) is the first conference to focus exclusively on the issues that affect people who write and use software in research. It is not a standard academic conference! We welcome researchers, but we also want to hear from people who may not typically attend conferences. It’s a community conference: get involved and help us build the RSE Community.**

**The conference will be held at the [Museum of Science and Industry, in Manchester, UK](conf2016_venue). More information about this venue and how to get there is [available on this page](conf2016_venue).**

**Call for talks and workshops open now – [submit your proposal](conf2016_calls) by 10th June**

From running a workshop to sharing your ideas or simply attending, there are many ways in which you can participate. We want to hear from you about the new technologies and techniques that help you in your work. We want your opinions on what will make the conference even more useful. And, of course, we want you to attend!

We’ve described the many different ways you can participate below. Take a look, and [get in touch](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk) if you’d like more information.

## What’s an RSE?

Research Software Engineers are the people who work in research, but write code not papers. Most people who conduct the work of an RSE are not formally called a Research Software Engineer. 

Are you an RSE? [Read this page for more information](http://www.rse.ac.uk/who.html).

## Who should take part?

We’re looking for participation from anyone with an interest in software in research: people who develop software (regardless of your job title), researchers, people who provide tools. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never attended a conference before, if you have an interest in software, we want to hear from you!

We’re actively encouraging first-time speakers and workshop leaders to take part, and we’re offering support and mentoring to those people who would like it.

## Tell us what to do!

This is a community conference. To make it a success, we want to hear from the community about what they would like to see at the conference. Got a good idea (or even a criticism)? Please [get in touch](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk).

## Call for workshops

If you want to help others learn about a new tool, technology or methodology, then please [submit a workshop](conf2016_calls_workshops). Workshops can be on any topic - anything you think would be useful to help develop and deliver modern research software can be submitted as a workshop.

If selected, your workshop will be one of 12 that will be presented during the conference. These will be held in three sessions, with four workshops run in parallel (see [the programme](http://www.rse.ac.uk/conf2016_programme))

For more details about submitting a workshop, [read the workshop page](conf2016_calls_workshops).

## Call for talks

We’re looking for talks that discuss and expand on issues that affect RSEs. You could announce a new code, discuss the application of a technology in a new context, or describe a technique that could be applied more widely.

We’re also interested in other topics related to software in research and how it is developed - from non-technical skills RSEs need, to cultural issues our community must address. Personal experiences are welcome if you can make them relevant to the audience. These are just a few examples though. We hope to get some suggestions that surprise us!

20 talks will be presented during the conference, each lasting 15 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions. They will be held in three sessions, with four talks running in parallel (see [the programme](http://www.rse.ac.uk/conf2016_programme)).

For more details about submitting a talk, [read the talk page](conf2016_calls_talks).

## UKRSE AGM

We will also be holding the UKRSE Annual General Meeting during the conference. This is your chance to influence the community through discussions, voting or standing for an official role.

We will circulate more details about the AGM nearer the time.

## Attend!

Attendees will learn about the cutting edge techniques being used in research, pick up new skills, and hear from a broad range of speakers.

Registration will open in June. We’re limited to 150 attendees at this first conference. 
If you provide your contact details using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13UDEEL4YeWeo-e7ioUVqdxfMul3aG7mAIbUU3iUF_aI/viewform?edit_requested=true), we’ll send you a reminder once registration is open.

We’re looking for sponsors to provide bursaries to help us reduce registration fees and cover the costs of travel and accommodation for some attendees.

## Sponsorship

For the first time, we’re getting together people from across the UK (and beyond) who develop and use research software.  We’re looking for sponsors to help us increase participation by keeping registration fees low.

We have various levels of sponsorship, each of which is associated with different benefits. For more information, visit [our sponsorship page](conf2016_sponsors).

## Exhibitors

We have some limited space for exhibitors. If you’d like to showcase your products to the people who make the technical decisions in research, then [please get in touch](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk).

## Volunteer

We need help on the day to run workshops, organise talks, and help with the behind the scenes running of the workshop. If you’re interested in getting involved in the RSE Community, or want experience in running a conference, then [please get in touch](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk).
