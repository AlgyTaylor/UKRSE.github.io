This conference would not be possible without the support the EPSRC provides
via the RSE-Network, which we gratefully acknowledge. 

Research Software Engineers and research software developers come from a 
variety of backgrounds and work in a range of different careers and positions.
To ensure the widest access for participants of this conference,
we are actively seeking sponsors. The conference will cater to approximately
150 research software developers and research software engineers from across
the UK and further abroad. Together, they will be engaged in research software
development across all fields of computational research and academic software 
development. If you would like to present a stand, present a sponsored talk,
demonstrate a technology at a sponsored workshop, advertise your logo or
other material on our website or at the conference, or otherwise engage with
this vibrant community of programmers and researchers, then please consider
sponsoring this meeting. For information about sponsorship, prices, and 
different tiers of support, please contact [Simon Hettrick](mailto:s.hettrick@software.ac.uk).
